# Text-to-Speech Chrome Extension ðŸš€

## Problem Statement
While traveling or multitasking, it is often difficult to read information on webpages. Whether you're commuting, driving, or performing tasks that require your hands and eyes, reading can become inconvenient or unsafe. The problem is to access that textual content on-the-go, hands-free, by listening to it instead.

## Solution
This Chrome extension allows users to select text on any webpage, choose a language (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu), and have the text read aloud using the browser's speech synthesis capabilities. It makes consuming information easier, especially in situations where reading is impractical.

## Files Structure

### 1. `manifest.json`
Defines the Chrome extension, its permissions, and which files are associated with various parts of the extension. This file declares the extension's popup page, required permissions (such as access to active tabs and executing scripts), and metadata.

### 2. `popup.html`
This file contains the basic structure of the extension's UI. It includes:
- A text area to display the selected text.
- A dropdown for users to select their preferred language (English, Hindi, Telugu).
- A "Speak" button that triggers the speech synthesis.
  
### 3. `popup.js`
Contains the main logic for the extension, which includes:
- Retrieving the user's selected text from the active webpage.
- Translating the text (if necessary) using the MyMemory Translation API.
- Using the Web Speech API to read the text aloud in the selected language.
- Adding event listeners to handle user interactions like selecting a language and clicking the "Speak" button.

### 4. `styles.css`
Basic CSS file to style the popup interface. It provides layout and aesthetic improvements such as font settings, button styles, and the general appearance of the popup.

## How It Works

1. **Selecting Text**:
   - When you highlight text on a webpage, the extension captures the selected text and displays it in the popup UI.

2. **Language Selection**:
   - The user can choose from the available languages (English, Hindi, Telugu) via a dropdown menu.

3. **Speaking the Text**:
   - Once the user clicks the "Speak" button, the extension translates the selected text (if a language other than English is chosen) using the MyMemory Translation API.
   - After translation, the Web Speech API is invoked to read the translated (or original) text aloud in the chosen language.
